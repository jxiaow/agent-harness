# agent-harness

A portable process layer for AI coding agents. It makes agents state requirements, choose a design, implement within project rules, verify the result, and deliver a clear closeout — instead of jumping straight into edits.

For teams using Codex, Claude Code, Kiro, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or custom agents in real repositories.

## Who Should Read What

| You are… | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Developer integrating harness into a project | [Quick Start](#quick-start) |
| Agent maintainer or harness contributor | [docs/maintaining.md](docs/maintaining.md) |
| Curious about the full workflow details | [docs/workflow-reference.md](docs/workflow-reference.md) |

---

## The Problem

AI coding agents fail in predictable ways:

- Start coding before the requirement boundary is clear
- Make local fixes that violate project architecture
- Call one work package "done" while the larger migration is still open
- Mix stable docs, transition plans, and execution checklists in the same place
- Say something is verified without showing what was actually run

agent-harness turns those failure modes into a repeatable workflow:

```
Requirement → Design → Implementation → Verification → Delivery
```

The point is not ceremony — it's making agent work reviewable, recoverable, and less likely to drift.

---

## What You Get

- **Task templates** — cover bug fixes, new features, refactors, UI adjustments, and cross-module changes.
- **Stage gates** — force the agent to record scope, design, implementation, verification, and delivery.
- **Autopilot rules** — gates are process records, not approval pauses.
- **Project adaptation layer** — captures repo facts, high-risk paths, and local rules.
- **Operations docs** — support long-running migrations and multi-stage remediation.
- **Lightweight process checks** — catch Markdown structure issues and known harness rule violations.

## 30-Second Example

Without a process layer:

```text
User: Fix the deployment page bug.
Agent: I changed three files. It should work now.
```

With agent-harness:

```text
Task type
Bug

Requirement gate
- Symptom: deployment page fails when the selected host is missing.
- Boundary: keep API shape and routing unchanged.
- Expected behavior: show an actionable empty state.
- Verification: targeted unit test and smoke path.

Design gate
- Fix point: normalize missing host state in the store, not inside the component.
- Risk: host selection is shared by deployment and branch flows.
- Rules: preserve Pinia state path and existing router entry.

Verification gate
- `npm run test:unit -- deploy-host-selection`: pass
- Manual smoke: deployment page empty state renders
- Not covered: real SSH connection
```

The agent still moves fast, but reviewers can see what it understood, what it changed, and what it didn't verify.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jxiaow/agent-harness.git harness/core
mkdir -p harness/project/rules
```

### 2. Tell the AI

> Read `harness/core/ONBOARD.md` and generate the profile and rules for this repository.

The AI will:

1. Scan your repo structure (package.json, directories, entry points, routes, etc.)
2. Generate `harness/project/profile.md` — project facts, module placement, high-risk paths, red lines
3. Generate `harness/project/rules/*.md` — project-specific rules based on identified risk points (typically 1–3 for simple projects, 5–8 for complex ones)
4. Generate `AGENTS.md` at repo root — workflow entry point with your project's hard constraints

### 3. Done

Your repo now has a complete agent workflow. Every AI agent that reads `AGENTS.md` will follow the gate process.

### What the generated profile looks like

`harness/project/profile.md` contains:

```markdown
# Project Profile

## Stack
(Tech stack: language, framework, build tools)

## Repository Shape
(Core directory tree, max 15 lines)

## Product Chain Map
(Main business chains, 3–8 items)

## Module Placement
(Table: where new code should go by type)

## High-Risk Changes
(Files requiring extra caution)

## Active Rules / Reading Sets
(Which rules to read by task type)

## Project Hard Constraints
(Red lines: what must not be bypassed)
```

## How It Works

```
harness/
├── core/                    ← submodule (generic, independently upgradable)

│   ├── ONBOARD.md           # AI reads this to set up a new project
│   ├── gates/               # Stage gate definitions
│   ├── templates/           # Task type templates (bug-fix, new-feature, etc.)

└── project/                 ← project-specific (never overwritten by core updates)
    ├── profile.md           # Project facts, chains, placement, constraints
    └── rules/               # Project-specific rules
```

**core/** is generic — it defines the workflow, gates, and templates. It knows nothing about your project.

**project/** is specific — it contains your project's architecture facts, risk points, and red lines. The AI generates this for you based on your actual repo structure.

## Workflow

Every task follows:

```
1. Declare task type (bug / feature / refactor / UI / cross-module)
2. Requirement gate — what are we solving, what's in/out of scope
3. Design gate — where to change, what's the risk, how to verify
4. Implementation — write code following project rules
5. Verification gate — what was verified, what wasn't, residual risk
6. Delivery gate — closeout with evidence
```

Gates are process records, not approval pauses. The agent outputs them and keeps going unless there's a real blocker (needs user authorization, would overwrite existing work, requirement changed significantly, or key input is missing).

---

## Auto Trigger

The agent automatically enters the workflow when it detects keywords:

| Keywords | Template |
| --- | --- |
| fix / bug / error | `bug-fix` |
| refactor / optimize / clean up | `refactor` |
| add / create / implement | `new-feature` |
| adjust / restyle | `ui-adjustment` |
| cross-module / affects multiple | `cross-module-change` |

---

## Compatibility

agent-harness is agent-agnostic. It works with any AI coding agent that reads Markdown instructions:

| Agent | How it picks up harness |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | Reads `AGENTS.md` at repo root |
| Claude Code | Reads `AGENTS.md` at repo root |
| Kiro | Reads `AGENTS.md` via steering rules |
| Gemini CLI | Reads `AGENTS.md` at repo root |
| Cursor | Reads `.cursorrules` or `AGENTS.md` |
| Custom agents | Point them at `AGENTS.md` |

No runtime dependency. No SDK. Just Markdown files that shape agent behavior.

---

## Update Core

```bash
cd harness/core && git pull origin main
cd ../.. && git add harness/core && git commit -m "chore: update harness core"
```

## Clone a Repo with Submodule

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <your-repo>
# or for existing clones:
git submodule update --init
```

---

## Optional npm Scripts

Add these to your `package.json` for convenient access:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "process:check": "node harness/core/automation/check-process.js",
    "harness:check": "node harness/core/automation/check-harness.js",
    "harness:ops:init": "node harness/core/operations/create-operation-docs.js"
  }
}
```

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `process:check` | Check Markdown structure and gate conventions |
| `harness:check` | Combined check — runs process + project entry checks sequentially |
| `harness:ops:init` | Create operations workspace for long-running initiatives |

Usage tips:
- Daily wrap-up: `npm run harness:check -- --changed --summary --max-issues 3`
- Pre-commit: `npm run harness:check -- --staged --summary`
- Full scan: `npm run process:check`

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| AI doesn't enter the workflow automatically | Make sure `AGENTS.md` is at repo root and contains the auto-trigger keyword table. Some agents need a restart to pick up new files. |
| Submodule shows empty after clone | Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` |
| Submodule conflicts on merge | Run `git checkout --theirs harness/core && git submodule update --init` then verify the core version is acceptable |
| AI generates too many / too few rules | Edit `harness/project/rules/` manually. Rules should match real risk points, not theoretical completeness. |
| Gates feel too verbose | Gates are meant to be short bullets. If the AI writes paragraphs, remind it: "gates are process records, keep them to short bullets." |
| `check-process.js` reports false positives | Check if your Markdown follows the expected heading structure. Run with `--summary` to see which rules triggered. |
