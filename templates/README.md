# Templates

This directory contains task type templates.

Template list:

- `new-feature.md`
- `bug-fix.md`
- `refactor.md`
- `ui-adjustment.md`
- `cross-module-change.md`

Selection rules:

- New functionality or new page: `new-feature.md`
- Fixing an anomaly or regression: `bug-fix.md`
- Restructuring without changing target behavior: `refactor.md`
- Local style or interaction adjustment: `ui-adjustment.md`
- Changes involving multiple modules: `cross-module-change.md`

Default requirements:

- Match the closest primary template first
- Only add minimal analysis points; inline into Requirement / Design gate by default, do not output a separate template section
- When multiple templates match, use the primary template and only supplement missing boundaries from secondary templates

Task sizing:

- `tiny`: template uses only 2-3 key fields; still must output Requirement / Design gate
- `normal`: use template default minimal analysis points
- `long-running`: beyond template fields, must first have a stage-level todo/checklist, execution order, and current first work package

Example:

```text
Refactor gate
- Goal: reduce repetition in process documentation
- Boundary: only change harness/core docs, not business code
- Focus: task sizing, responsibility layering, closeout evidence
- Verification: Markdown static check and diff review
```
